## 1. 
Assume that you are writing a mental math game for a child. To make it simple you design it to give practice on additions to the child. In this game, you generate two random integers(say, x and y) and show them on the screen as a sum in the following format: 
x + y = ?  
The child will enter the sum of these numbers. The program verifies the sum and prints a message correct or wrong. The sums appear as long as the child wants it. When the child wants to stop, the program displays the score of correct answers and the total sums she/he did. Let the game has two levels: easy and difficult. Easy game will have numbers from 0 to 9 to add. Difficult game will have numbers from 0 to 99 to add.
